Recently link:https://twitter.com/marekgoldmann/status/474867431736082432[I
announced the avaibility] of the official link:http://wildfly.org/[WildFly]
Docker image. Since that time link:https://hub.docker.com/u/jboss/[our
portfolio of images has grown a bit]. As of today we do have 8 images. But this
is not the end. We want to have *a nice collection* of JBoss' projects shipped as
Docker images.

=== Automated builds

All images are hooked up as
link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/[automated builds]. When we push
an update to link:https://github.com/jboss/dockerfiles[the repository], a new
build will be created and pushed to the global registry. I set up also links
between the images. If a base image will be updated - our images will be
rebuilt. This is a fully *automated* process that makes sure you get the latest
available software.

=== Docker microsite

Today I'm happy to announce the link:http://www.jboss.org/docker/[Docker dedicated microsite on jboss.org] website.

We crafted the http://jboss.org/docker website
to show all the images we currently ship in one place. Additionally you can find there
basic information about each project and detailed information about each image.

Of course list of all repositories is available from the link:https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/jboss/[hub.docker.com] website too!

=== Help us to help you!

We're happy to add new new images! You can even help us by
link:https://github.com/jboss/dockerfiles/pulls[opening a pull request] or just
link:https://github.com/jboss/dockerfiles/issues[let us know] what projects you
would like to see in the portfolio. Do not hesitate to create bug reports (if
you find any) too!
