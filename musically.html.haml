%h1 Musically

%p I always like to listen to music. It's hard to describe what type of music is my favourite. Maybe something between electro-house, electro-pop, ambient, dub, minimal and microhouse.

%p My favorite artists are (in no particular order): Luomo, Feist, Sacha Funke, Ellen Allien, Lykke Li, Paul Kalkbrenner, Little Dragon, Radiohead, Smolik, Vladislav Delay, Daft Punk... and many others.

%p In my free (what?!) time I try to produce some music myself.
